##  Overview

This project created a new applciation using 2012 Major League Baseball team data that captures payroll and the number of wins.  Functionality has been added to display, edit, add and delete infomormation as needed. 

I used data from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html. Major League Baseball 2012 Season: Team, Payroll(millions), Wins. 30 records, each with 3 values. There is also an initial header line. The data was converted by utilizing https://sqlizer.io/#/ to convert mlb_teams_2012.csv
